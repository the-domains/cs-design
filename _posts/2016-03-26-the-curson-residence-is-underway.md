The Curson Residence is underway!

We're adding on a 500 sf addition to a home in West Los Angeles. We had to remove a portion of the existing deck in order to accommodate the addition.

In this pic, the excavations are being dug for the foundation's footings. Since we have some tight constraints, and the footings aren't that deep, it's actually quicker to dig them by hand.
